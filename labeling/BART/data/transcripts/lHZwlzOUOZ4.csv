106.799,3.541,"glance and that's a very valid criticism"
108.659,3.42,"and likely the main turn off for people"
110.34,3.48,"when they first look into using Tailwind"
112.079,3.18,"however the benefit is that you don't"
113.82,3.36,"have all these arbitrary class names"
115.259,3.72,"anymore and know exactly which Styles"
117.18,3.42,"apply to it and that just clears a ton"

123.84,3.72,"here's a little Pro tip if you're using"
126.18,3.6,"tailwind and hate the way your HTML"
127.56,3.72,"looks the inline fold vs code extension"
129.78,3.78,"can automatically minimize it for you"
131.28,4.26,"problem number two is that CSS is for"
133.56,4.5,"Bose remember everything in Tailwind is"
135.54,4.68,"just CSS hover over any class to view"
138.06,3.72,"the actual CSS code what's cool about it"
140.22,3.96,"though is that it uses clever naming"
141.78,4.2,"conventions like inset 0 to do something"
144.18,3.6,"in one line of code that would take six"
145.98,3.66,"lines of CSS because it combines"
147.78,3.539,"properties and values together I would"
149.64,3.36,"estimate that Tailwind results in"
151.319,3.541,"approximately one-third the total amount"
153.0,3.9,"of code that you would have with vanilla"
154.86,3.959,"CSS and the best type of code is the"
156.9,3.72,"code you never have to write however a"
158.819,3.481,"valid criticism of this approach is that"
160.62,3.839,"you have to learn an abstraction on top"
162.3,3.9,"of CSS which is not ideal it's always"
164.459,3.541,"best to use the platform natively but"
166.2,4.02,"the web platform is often cruel and"
168.0,3.9,"vengeful Now problem three is that CSS"
170.22,3.599,"gives you too much control over the UI"
171.9,3.72,"while Frameworks like bootstrap are too"
173.819,3.301,"difficult to customize Tailwind Falls"
175.62,2.94,"right in the middle of these giving you"
177.12,3.24,"a standard set of constraints to make"
178.56,4.08,"sure the UI looks good but tends to be"
180.36,4.019,"much easier to custom to accommodate any"
182.64,3.239,"design like when you build a bootstrap"
184.379,3.121,"app it always tends to look like a"
185.879,3.241,"bootstrap app with Tailwind is not so"
187.5,3.599,"obvious now the final problem I want to"
189.12,3.6,"talk about is zombie Styles we have a"
191.099,3.78,"tendency to write styles that never"
192.72,4.019,"actually get used and just blow the CSS"
194.879,4.08,"bundle Tailwind will automatically Purge"
196.739,4.201,"all unused styles to kill the Zombies"
198.959,3.78,"and remove this dead code that's pretty"
200.94,3.6,"cool but the drawback is that Tailwind"
202.739,3.36,"is a pretty heavy-handed approach it"
204.54,4.02,"takes like five steps to set up to"
206.099,4.56,"install the Tailwind CLI post CSS and"
208.56,4.02,"the vs code extension for that reason I"
210.659,4.201,"only use it on big projects for smaller"
212.58,3.78,"demos I've been using Pico CSS which can"
214.86,3.48,"make things look good with zero effort"
216.36,3.84,"thanks to its classless approach as you"
218.34,3.479,"can see there are many pros and cons to"
220.2,3.539,"a library like Tailwind ultimately"
221.819,3.721,"here's a good rule you can go by if you"
223.739,4.021,"like Tailwind use it if you don't like"
225.54,3.6,"Tailwind don't use it nobody cares"
227.76,3.36,"literally nobody cares about your"
229.14,3.659,"technology choices except you this has"
231.12,5.119,"been the code report thanks for watching"
232.799,3.44,"and I will see you in the next one"
