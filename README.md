# Short Form Learning - Machine Learning

This repository contains all things machine learning for the short-form learning project.

## Architecture

TODO:  overall descriptions of code organization and tools and libraries used

## Setup

We use [`conda`][conda] for Python package management.

### Installing `conda`

First, check if you have `conda` installed on your machine:

```bash
conda --version
# if you get an error, you do not have conda installed
```

To install `conda`, follow the instructions [here][conda-install].

The environment is defined in [`environment.yml`][env].  
To install the environment, run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
