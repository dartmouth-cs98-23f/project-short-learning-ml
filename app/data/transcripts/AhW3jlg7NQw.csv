0.0,4.44,these three interior designers have been
2.159,4.74,given a photograph of an empty Galley
4.44,4.86,kitchen they have free reign to design
6.899,4.921,it in any way they please my name is
9.3,4.919,Courtney McLeod and my design style is
11.82,4.559,elegant but with a wink and a smile I
14.219,5.041,have Sasha baikov in my design style
16.379,5.641,would be if Marie Antoinette was at
19.26,5.04,Studio 54. my name is Becky Carter and
22.02,5.579,my designs are fearless architectural
24.3,7.2,and Palette Savvy no clients no
27.599,7.8,restrictions just Blank Space
31.5,7.34,this is definitely a typical City
35.399,6.601,Kitchen it's small it's sad
38.84,6.16,what I don't love is that this window
42.0,5.399,just it's not getting celebrated we are
45.0,5.82,really limited on space we're really
47.399,8.18,gonna have to rework this floor plan in
50.82,4.759,order to make things all fit
56.52,4.92,I think in a kitchen one of the coolest
59.039,6.181,things that you can do especially in a
61.44,6.48,small kitchen is to do tile but tile
65.22,6.92,everywhere I'm selecting a really
67.92,8.76,beautiful Rich sky blue for my wall tile
72.14,8.26,and this one in particular is a fabulous
76.68,5.88,hand glazed tile by fire clay tile and
80.4,5.52,it really just made me think of Nature
82.56,7.32,and the outdoors I've decided to go with
85.92,6.66,a small scale one by one Mosaic I think
89.88,5.94,that this kitchen wants to kind of feel
92.58,7.44,both retro and futuristic at the same
95.82,6.479,time and so I like the yellow because it
100.02,4.44,is a bit of a retro color I think I want
102.299,4.201,to keep this kitchen really light and
104.46,5.159,bright because it's a small Galley
106.5,6.119,kitchen I'm going to cover our walls in
109.619,5.341,a travertine it's a natural stone it's
112.619,4.381,going to add this like sense of luxury
114.96,4.619,into the space on our door way
117.0,6.24,separating the adjacent space to the
119.579,6.9,kitchen I've decided to make this wall a
123.24,5.579,little bit of a wing here and I'm going
126.479,6.12,to be adding a marquetry sort of a
128.819,6.541,parquet up the side of this wall parquet
132.599,4.441,and marquetry is something that's
135.36,3.54,commonly seen in more historical
137.04,4.02,buildings and I just think it would be
138.9,4.58,really fun in my sort of futurist
141.06,2.42,kitchen
144.84,3.899,for the ceiling I'm going to do the
147.12,3.78,stainless steel ceiling because I want
148.739,4.621,it to be reflective and I really like
150.9,4.26,how the travertine and stainless steel
153.36,4.26,kind of go together it's really
155.16,4.5,important that I keep this kitchen light
157.62,4.56,so that you can see when you cook on the
159.66,4.92,ceiling I'm going to be cladding the
162.18,4.62,whole thing with a walnut the kitchen is
164.58,4.92,inherently going to be a space with a
166.8,4.2,lot of hard surfaces and I would like to
169.5,5.04,bring in some warmth and some natural
171.0,6.18,wood by putting wood on the ceiling so
174.54,5.64,the ceiling everyone forgets the fifth
177.18,5.94,wall but I love love love to put
180.18,5.46,interest on a ceiling and so in this
183.12,4.08,space I'm planning to introduce a
185.64,5.54,wonderful pattern from a company called
187.2,7.44,porter tilio and they do these amazing
191.18,5.38,hand-painted wallpapers on Japanese tea
194.64,4.379,paper
196.56,5.459,foreign
199.019,6.0,so in this kitchen we have what looks
202.019,5.521,like an oak floor it's not a very
205.019,4.261,remarkable material I want to go with
207.54,3.9,something that's just a little bit more
209.28,4.56,flashy the flooring that we're going to
211.44,5.1,be working with here is very heavily
213.84,5.64,inspired by a designer named geoponte
216.54,6.0,and what I'm doing is I'm creating a
219.48,5.759,geometric field of different colors and
222.54,4.68,Stones using all these different kind of
225.239,4.321,stone colors these could be marbles
227.22,4.799,granites quartzites you name it I'm
229.56,4.92,going to use the same travertine stone
232.019,6.36,that I'm using on the walls on the floor
234.48,6.36,as well I want there to be a really nice
238.379,5.041,transition from the walls to the floors
240.84,5.16,so I really want to incorporate
243.42,5.16,additional pattern into the space and so
246.0,5.22,for me the ceiling and the floor are
248.58,5.219,going to Echo each other my best piece
251.22,5.28,of advice when you're trying to live on
253.799,6.06,the edge with pattern is to remember
256.5,5.459,scale so if you're working with two bold
259.859,6.06,patterns you want to have one that's
261.959,5.821,more loose larger more abstract and then
265.919,4.861,you want to pair that with a pattern
267.78,5.87,that is tighter more regimented but in
270.78,5.96,the same or a complementary palette
273.65,6.609,[Music]
276.74,5.62,so the window has this very heavy black
280.259,5.94,frame the window frame that I would like
282.36,6.0,to do is Stone we're going to be using
286.199,5.22,one of the stones from the floor which
288.36,5.88,will be this yellow I'm also changing
291.419,4.681,the design of the framing so instead of
294.24,5.16,having this more traditional kind of
296.1,5.819,four panel window system I'm switching
299.4,4.98,it out to a design that feels a little
301.919,4.201,bit more like something you would see in
304.38,5.099,a more kind of European modernist
306.12,6.96,apartment I designed a custom roller
309.479,6.301,shade that is made with brown leather
313.08,6.119,and perforated with holes so that you
315.78,7.919,get these little peekaboos of the scene
319.199,8.401,behind the window I am going to take off
323.699,7.741,the window frame and I think I'm going
327.6,7.2,to just create a more simple window
331.44,6.96,frame around this window so for the
334.8,6.66,window I wanted to do something that
338.4,7.44,will be a bit of a literal translation
341.46,7.98,of a piece from the artist Tomas sarceno
345.84,6.299,his piece is a three-dimensional object
349.44,6.66,and so I thought it would be really cool
352.139,8.0,to flatten that design and to turn it
356.1,4.039,into a stained glass window
361.08,6.059,so the first thing I want to do is move
363.78,6.3,the sink underneath the window and the
367.139,5.161,idea behind this is that you can wash
370.08,4.44,your dishes you can clean your fruits
372.3,5.22,and you can really enjoy this view now
374.52,5.22,for me in a small kitchen like this the
377.52,6.119,best real estate is right next to the
379.74,6.899,window so I really don't want to ruin
383.639,6.06,that area with just a really big blocky
386.639,7.441,piece and so I want to actually flip
389.699,6.84,that and move that tall solid piece away
394.08,5.94,from the window so that I can open that
396.539,6.361,up and instead use that as a space that
400.02,4.679,will be a work prep area when I got the
402.9,3.96,heartbreaking news from idea that I
404.699,4.741,could not take down this wall I started
406.86,5.279,to really lean into a true Galley
409.44,5.9,kitchen I started doing research on
412.139,5.4,luxury Yachts trailers airstreams
415.34,4.359,airplanes if you have to have a real
417.539,4.201,Galley let's look at some real galleys
419.699,5.101,I'm going to be making my upper cabinets
421.74,5.94,so that they are designed to be angled
424.8,4.56,and the angle is going to be tighter at
427.68,4.739,the bottom and wider at the top
429.36,4.679,something that I love about this is it
432.419,4.681,kind of feels like Marvin the Martian
434.039,5.641,it's giving this spaceship Vibe I'm
437.1,5.52,paneling the fridge and all of our
439.68,4.919,Cabinetry in stainless steel and the way
442.62,5.16,that the steel works with the travertine
444.599,6.181,it's almost like a natural material with
447.78,5.039,this kind of like reflective silvery
450.78,4.68,finish you're almost not going to see
452.819,5.341,any of the appliances in my kitchen for
455.46,6.66,the cabinets in my kitchen I am planning
458.16,6.599,to use a corally pinky red I really
462.12,4.919,thought that it would help to reinforce
464.759,5.041,the nature or natural Vibe of the space
467.039,5.94,and be a perfect complement to the sky
469.8,6.239,blue of the wall tile I've Incorporated
472.979,6.0,a bit of shine through a lacquer finish
476.039,5.581,so that will definitely add to making
478.979,4.62,the space feel brighter what I I really
481.62,4.139,don't like you would walk into the space
483.599,4.981,and the first thing you would see would
485.759,4.861,kind of be this like big refrigerator I
488.58,3.66,always like to hide them so what I'm
490.62,3.419,going to do with the fridge is I'm going
492.24,5.459,to move it to the left side of the space
494.039,6.241,that way when you walk into the room you
497.699,5.641,are not going to you know see the fridge
500.28,5.099,first so on my upper cabinets I'm going
503.34,4.5,to be designing them with these porthole
505.379,5.16,windows that allow you to see ever so
507.84,6.059,slightly into the cabinets themselves I
510.539,6.06,like it because it does harken back to a
513.899,5.281,little bit of a marine feel it might be
516.599,5.161,something you would see on a boat or you
519.18,5.52,might see it in a vintage trailer I have
521.76,5.34,Incorporated very tall upper cabinets
524.7,4.68,it's really to take advantage of all the
527.1,5.7,ceiling height to get as much storage as
529.38,7.079,I possibly can I've also made sure to do
532.8,6.719,a variety of doors and drawers to really
536.459,6.121,add a lot of functionality and variety
539.519,6.061,that is perfect for a small kitchen so
542.58,5.52,for the lowers what we're doing is we're
545.58,5.939,doing a custom kitchen from a kitchen
548.1,6.0,company called abomas they make these
551.519,5.161,cabinets and they started out in
554.1,5.1,creating Custom Kitchens for Yachts so
556.68,6.06,this is going to be a beautiful brushed
559.2,6.48,stainless it is restaurant grade and Ava
562.74,5.4,Miss designed them so that the burners
565.68,4.44,of the range are just set into the
568.14,4.259,countertop the whole thing is this
570.12,4.38,monolithic piece of Steel it's
572.399,4.741,incredibly architectural it's incredibly
574.5,5.58,simple but at the same time has this
577.14,5.699,really bizarre fun warmth to it it has
580.08,5.52,these brass poles that I think really
582.839,6.241,warm it up and add that kind of feeling
585.6,7.56,of jewelry because we moved around our
589.08,6.6,kitchen appliances we have created way
593.16,6.179,more counter space this is really great
595.68,5.7,because you can now use this space for
599.339,4.62,prep but you can also enter entertain
601.38,4.92,more easily and you can have a bunch of
603.959,5.281,dishes or hors d'oeuvres kind of on this
606.3,6.12,counter I think that the client for this
609.24,4.8,kitchen they might be City people who
612.42,3.84,moved out to the country and this is
614.04,4.739,their pieta tear so I thought to myself
616.26,5.4,why take up so much space and energy
618.779,5.221,using a full-size fridge when there are
621.66,5.22,really excellent drawer fridge products
624.0,5.7,out there one of the focal points for my
626.88,6.78,kitchen will be a beautiful Suite of
629.7,7.92,bertazoni appliances and for this
633.66,6.42,kitchen I'm using a white range which
637.62,4.32,you know is a little bit unusual but I
640.08,4.439,think it's perfect for this light and
641.94,5.519,Airy space it also has all of these
644.519,4.56,wonderful brass accents to it brass is
647.459,4.32,something that I want to bounce around
649.079,4.681,the room so it's a really like a piece
651.779,4.56,of jewelry within the space a functional
653.76,5.94,piece of jewelry but of course function
656.339,6.901,we need to have safety and so I've
659.7,6.06,Incorporated a complementary vent hood
663.24,7.62,that is a perfect match I'm a big
665.76,8.94,collector of tabletop I love glassware I
670.86,6.24,love vases and urns so I think the best
674.7,4.319,part of a kitchen is definitely having
677.1,3.66,some open shelving and this adds
679.019,3.781,personality to your home I think that
680.76,4.8,not only is it beautiful to display your
682.8,4.8,objects but it's so handy it's like grab
685.56,5.04,and go you don't have to open up a door
687.6,5.82,to get to what you need I am moving the
690.6,5.28,sink towards the opening of the kitchen
693.42,5.52,I'm sliding it down that wall right
695.88,6.24,there and I'm doing it purely to make
698.94,5.04,room for the curve so by putting a sink
702.12,3.839,there that's given us some more
703.98,4.14,architecture to be able to create that
705.959,4.141,curved countertop in the back I really
708.12,4.14,wanted to create kind of this Eden
710.1,3.9,kitchen and I love a breakfast nook the
712.26,3.84,big cat is upholstered and I'm going to
714.0,5.04,do this Clarence House fabric I really
716.1,6.239,like this fabric because it's neutral
719.04,5.46,but it has a really fun kind of wavy
722.339,4.62,print to it the table I'm going to use
724.5,6.0,in this space is vintage it's from the
726.959,7.021,70s and it's also made of travertine and
730.5,6.48,it has a steel element to it on the
733.98,5.96,table top so it really matches perfectly
736.98,2.96,with our kitchen
741.12,5.52,you don't expect to see a fabulous
744.0,6.959,chandelier in a kitchen but I think you
746.64,7.319,should so here I want to lean into that
750.959,5.341,nature Vibe and I'm pulling a fixture
753.959,5.581,from Rosie Lee my favorite lighting
756.3,6.539,designer I'm using her Laurel Blossom
759.54,6.419,fixture which is like this but in more
762.839,5.041,of a brass finish the chandelier is
765.959,4.32,Matthew Lenore and it is from
767.88,4.019,Carpenter's workshop and I really was
770.279,4.321,attracted to this because it's like
771.899,6.24,these tubes of light it's super modern
774.6,6.419,it's fun and almost like these tubes of
778.139,5.341,light work really well with the Clarence
781.019,4.861,House fabric makes almost like this
783.48,5.28,similar pattern in a way the light over
785.88,5.399,the sink is a vintage light from an
788.76,6.54,Italian designer named Vico magistrative
791.279,6.541,it is a soft frosted glass Dome with a
795.3,5.279,globe inside of it and that's just gonna
797.82,5.28,give a really soft diffuse light
800.579,4.741,throughout the the entire space I love
803.1,4.38,to incorporate all different types of
805.32,4.5,lighting into a space so we have our
807.48,4.799,overhead light with our chandelier but
809.82,5.94,then we also have our counter lighting
812.279,5.761,with our LED strips and that's going to
815.76,4.56,like really give us this beautiful glow
818.04,5.58,in the space the last bit of lighting
820.32,5.699,was the Chrome picture light again like
823.62,5.1,very modern very simple instead of going
826.019,5.401,with a typical linear under cabinet
828.72,5.64,light what I've decided to do is pepper
831.42,5.34,the backsplash with Marine step lights
834.36,4.56,what you're seeing here is really cool
836.76,5.879,it's a little step light that normally
838.92,6.419,would be mounted maybe two feet above
842.639,5.401,the floor maybe a foot along a pathway
845.339,4.62,or up and down steps to help light your
848.04,4.32,path these ones specifically are
849.959,4.201,designed to go on a boat
852.36,5.219,foreign
854.16,6.239,the piece of artwork that I chose is an
857.579,5.581,iconic black and white image of Bianca
860.399,4.801,Jagger coming into Studio 54 on a white
863.16,4.56,horse I wanted something that was kind
865.2,5.16,of like iconic New York that went with
867.72,4.679,the view and went with our steel and our
870.36,5.159,metal and our traveler teen and also
872.399,5.101,this like wavy kind of groovy fabric I
875.519,5.101,like to hang art in my kitchens this is
877.5,6.66,a painting of the ocean and it sort of
880.62,6.48,feels like a little window looking out
884.16,6.359,to the sea I like that it's a sort of
887.1,5.64,tongue-in-cheek Nod at our fantasy ship
890.519,4.741,that we've created here my favorite
892.74,5.82,element of this room is my little herb
895.26,5.1,garden which is these Wall Planters that
898.56,4.2,I found that have this kind of like
900.36,4.14,futuristic Space Age feel to them
902.76,4.98,they're made of fiberglass and they go
904.5,6.66,directly onto the wall and in them is
907.74,5.88,basil and rosemary and parsley bringing
911.16,6.06,nature into the space I have styled the
913.62,6.42,countertop with an almond belfried tea
917.22,6.059,set they have a very bauhausian quality
920.04,6.06,to them they're super geometric and they
923.279,5.311,feel very simplified but also a little
926.1,4.979,bit out of this world
928.59,5.309,[Music]
931.079,6.0,I really love my kitchen it feels
933.899,6.961,personal and that's what I always try to
937.079,6.361,do in my designs to think of someone who
940.86,4.44,is not afraid to express themselves in
943.44,3.66,their home I think a lot of people kind
945.3,4.08,of like steer away from stainless steel
947.1,4.62,kitchens because they maybe feel like
949.38,4.74,it's too industrial but I think this is
951.72,5.22,a great example of how Chic and cool
954.12,5.399,they could look this is somebody who may
956.94,5.28,not be cooking elaborate meals but when
959.519,5.82,they have cereal or they get their
962.22,4.19,Chinese takeout they're doing it with
965.339,2.481,style

984.32,6.759,I love it okay I've got to know what was
988.56,5.82,the inspiration for for the seating this
991.079,6.18,is a Clarence House fabric I wanted like
994.38,6.18,this really clean metal kitchen with the
997.259,6.721,travertine so I was kind of just trying
1000.56,6.0,to think about what fabric would Funk it
1003.98,6.479,up a little bit but stay in this like
1006.56,6.06,kind of neutral base I love a wave so it
1010.459,5.041,kind of like brought everything to that
1012.62,5.459,like disco fun yeah zombies yeah it's
1015.5,5.04,such a great balance with like the Stark
1018.079,3.901,architecture of the kitchen and you kept
1020.54,3.06,everything so clean and linear and then
1021.98,3.479,the fabric just like flies in the face
1023.6,3.959,of that but yeah in this way that just
1025.459,4.921,like perfectly dials in my favorite
1027.559,5.88,details my little herb garden there this
1030.38,6.0,is for a cook so if you need some fresh
1033.439,5.781,Basilico you can just you know chop it
1036.38,2.84,off your wallet
1040.1,3.54,watch A vibe it's a whole vibe my
1042.38,3.24,thought was if I have to go Galley
1043.64,4.02,kitchen I'm going like real Galley
1045.62,5.1,kitchen so I started looking at the
1047.66,4.74,Kitchens on Yachts on airplanes in
1050.72,4.02,trailers and so there's a bit of
1052.4,5.34,inspiration coming from like vintage
1054.74,3.96,airstreams and that kind of feel that's
1057.74,3.36,where you're seeing some of these
1058.7,4.56,portholes in the stainless steel and
1061.1,5.28,then I was also trying to hearken in a
1063.26,5.94,little bit of like a Milano 60s Milan
1066.38,5.58,Vibes and I love the blue tile
1069.2,5.82,juxtaposed with that kind of like rose
1071.96,4.8,blush colored lacquered Cabinetry you
1075.02,5.22,know I was kind of thinking like this is
1076.76,5.34,the typical small a little cramped and
1080.24,3.299,dark New York City Kitchen and so I
1082.1,4.02,wanted to really bring in something
1083.539,4.5,light and Airy then I brought in a
1086.12,4.5,little bit more of a literal with the
1088.039,5.581,rosie Lee chandelier which I'm like a
1090.62,4.2,stained glass on the window yeah oh you
1093.62,3.86,know I just realized I'm kind of
1094.82,4.68,matching like oh you are
1097.48,3.96,I always say I always match your
1099.5,5.4,interior foreign
